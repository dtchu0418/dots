## Explain my thoughts on game, talk about some of the game content and how it teaches players
### Slide 3
One of the unique things about Noita is that it's less of a game and more of a sandbox experience. The games not balanced or easy to play because it's more like a proof of concept for the physics engine and mechanics than anything else. 

One of the things that Noita is really good at is teaching players Self-Directed learning.

### Slide 4
Noita has a perma-death format, so in comparison to a traditional roguelike where you gain upgrades as you keep playing, dying in Noita loses all your progress and you don't gain any permanent upgrades in between runs, you only get a better understanding of how the game works.

There also aren't any instructions in the game, just basic controls that teach you how to kick and select wands.

Because of this players have to learn all the mechanics on their own, mostly through trial and error. 

### Slide 5
One of the ways that Noita teaches players Self-Directed learning is through the Falling Everything engine, a engine which physically simulates every pixel in the game, meaning that you can break, set fire to, kick, and even ingest almost everything in the game. 

### Slide 6
Theres even an alchemy system with a bunch of different liquids and materials with unique interactions with the environment, players, monsters, and even other with materials.

By introducing a completely interactable environment, players are taughtto engage with the game and be curious.

### Slide 7
Another thing that gives the player a ton of flexibility is the wand-building system.

Wands can be loaded with different spells and stacked in different ways to achieve basically anything in the game. It starts out pretty tame, but as you progress you learn to do things like summon materials, teleport, fly, make sentient drones and even create the sun. 

### Slide 8
It's probably the most important system in the game, and learning wand-building is probably the only thing that will help you progress.

It's also the main goal of exploration, since theres actually not a lot of emphasis in beating the game. 

### Slide 9
The reality is that the starting area combined with the main boss fight that lets you beat the game is only about 10% of the entire map

The majority of content within the game isn't focused on beating the boss or killing enemies, but instead on discovering secrets and understanding different mechanics.

The design philosophy in Noita is about pursuing knowledge and understanding instead of game completion, and so a lot of the developers choices in game design are ultimately to help teach the player to discover things on their own.

### Slide 10
Some of the major ways that Noita teaches Self-Directed learning is by providing assessment structures in the form of safe zones with testing status, and teaching System Thinking through the implementation of randomness in the environment, which is pseudo-randomly generated, and through spell acquisition. 

### Slide 11
## Issues I had with the game
While I really enjoyed the game, it definitely has some issues, mainly due to the lack of a feedback loop. 
Because of the high amount of variance in each run and the steep learning curve, many of your deaths are seemingly random with little to no feedback, and it can be really discouraging especially when you're a new player.

The steep learning curve combined with the lack of explanation about the game means that it's very difficult to get players engaged initially, and most people would probably not enjoy the high difficulty.

Ultimately though, I did really enjoy playing it, and I would definitely recommend it if you're into roguelikes.
