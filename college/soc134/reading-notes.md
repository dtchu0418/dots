# Chapter 6
## Emergence of Lynch Mobs
Between 1880 and 1930 murdered more than 2300
Justified by arguing it was to kill rapists even though untrue
Many accusations not even by the "victim" but by family members as an excuse to lynch african americans
"Rape" used very usely, more just for people they didn't likes attitude

## Prisons 
Emerged alongside lynch mob, but took on a new role to re-enslave thousands of black workers
New laws to segregate and criminalize poor blacks through outlawing begging and loitering

## The Prison Boom
Japanese americans targeted seen as spies and traitors
Prison population grew despite being criticizes as inherently racist institutions
1975 prison population skyrocketed

## The Color of America's Incarcerated
America has an unprecedentedly high incarceration rate, but mostly comprised of poor undereducated black and Hispanic men.
High school dropout rate extremely high for young men of color as well
Young black men incarceration rate is nearly 50 times the national average
***Why did prison population increase so much?***
- Rising crime rates
- Only 12 percent of rise in incarceration rates was due to increases in crime rate
- 88% increae was caused by changes in sentencing policies
- Crimes punished more harshly

## Rise of the "Law and Order" Politician
Richard Nixon started a "war on crime" which in reality was a racial issue
Followed by "war on drugs"
Once this type of politican was established, it became difficult to be elected without following this framework
Clinton supported new prisons and life sentences heavily
Prisons are basically a factory, for extremely cheap mandatory labor
Fueled prison boom, drug-related offenses increased despite the stagnation in drug use rates
Whites and blacks used drugs equally, but harsher penalties given to drugs that blacks used

## Fear
Fear of crime mostly due to racial identity, racial attitudes, and racial makeup of neighborhood
Media disproportionally showcasing white victims in media leads to increased racial fear
In fact, immigrants makes communities safer research shows

## The Arabization of Terrorism
9/11 Caused a lot of fear against arab looking people, hugely reported increases in crimes against arabs in 2001 after 9/11
Terrorism has been seen as a newfound thing after 9/11, but in reality the KKK is a terrorist organization, America is no stranger to terrorism, it has been perpetuating and enabling it for decades before 9/11, 9/11 was just an incident shown fast-first in media.
